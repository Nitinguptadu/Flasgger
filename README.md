Flasgger is a Flask extension to extract OpenAPI-Specification from all Flask views registered in your API. 


Flasgger also comes with SwaggerUI embedded so you can access http://localhost:5000/apidocs and visualize and interact with your API resources.  


Flasgger also provides validation of the incoming data, using the same specification it can validates if the data received as as a POST, PUT, PATCH is valid against the schema defined using YAML, Python dictionaries or Marshmallow Schemas. 


Flasgger can work with simple function views or MethodViews using docstring as specification, or using @swag_from decorator to get specification from YAML or dict and also provides SwaggerView which can use Marshmallow Schemas as specification. 


Flasgger is compatible with Flask-RESTful so you can use Resources and swag specifications together, take a look at restful example.  

Flasgger also supports Marshmallow APISpec as base template for specification, if you are using APISPec from Marshmallow take a look at apispec example.
